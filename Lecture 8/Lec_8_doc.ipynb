    "# Lecture 8\n",
    "This directory contains files and resources related to **Lecture 8**. Below is a summary of its contents:\n",
    "- `taylor_green_poorly_written.py`: A very poorly written code to compute the flow-field of a Taylor-Greeen vortex. This code has multiple syntax errors and numerical errors. One should never write a code like this.\n",
    "- `taylor_green_no_errors.py`: After resolving all the errors in taylor_green_poorly_written.py script.\n",
    "- `taylor_green_best.py`: An example script that is written in a much better way following best practice.\n",
    "The above python scripts demonstrate the common coding mistakes and the best practice coding with example codes that compute the Taylor-Green vortex fields and compares the numerically computed fields with repect to the values obtained from theoretical equations. This document highlights bad coding practices to avoid towards the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Taylor-Green vortex:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Taylor-Green vortex is an unsteady flow of decaying vortex with an exact closed-form analytical solution of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in Cartesian coordinates. This makes it an excellent benchmark for validating numerical models. The stream function ($\psi$) and vorticity ($\omega$) of the Taylor-Green vortex flow is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "ψ(x, y, t) = sin(x) sin(y) e^(-2νt)\n",
    "ω(x, y, t) = -2sin(x) sin(y) e^(-2νt)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where, x and y are the Cartesian coordinates in the range [0, 2π]; ν is kinematic viscosity, and t indicates time. Based on this stream function, the velocity fields can be derived as:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "u_x = ∂ψ/∂y, u_y = -∂ψ/∂x\n",
    "u_x = sin(x) cos(y) e^(-2νt), u_y = -cos(x) sin(y) e^(-2νt)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "ω = ∂u_y/∂x - ∂u_x/∂y\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The vorticity (ω) of the flow-field is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "ω = -2sin(x) sin(y) e^(-2νt)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the Taylor-Green vortex has an exact closed form analytical solution, often it is used as benchmark reference case for validating numerical models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Coding steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Generate a uniformly spaced 2D Cartesian grid (x_i, y_j), having N_x and N_y number of grid points along x- and y-directions respectively. Consider N_x = N_y = 100.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Compute the velocity, stream function and vorticity fields on the (x_i, y_j) grid using the theoretical expressions for ν = 0.1 m²/s at t = 0 s.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Next, compute the velocity fields (u_x, u_y) from the stream function by performing numerical differentiation such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "u_x = ∂ψ/∂y, u_y = -∂ψ/∂x\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Then compute the vorticity field based on the velocity field (u_x, u_y) as below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "ω = ∂u_y/∂x - ∂u_x/∂y\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Evaluate the differentiations numerically following the step 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "∂ψ/∂x ≈ (ψ(x_i + Δx, y_j) - ψ(x_i, y_j)) / Δx\n",
    "∂ψ/∂y ≈ (ψ(x_i, y_j + Δy) - ψ(x_i, y_j)) / Δy\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Now compute the error of the fields computed numerically with respect to their theoretical values:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Error = max | φ_num - φ_theo |\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "where φ indicates any field variable. Print the maximum error over the entire domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Finally, plot all the velocity and vorticity fields computed using both theoretical and numerical methods along with the error fields. Plot the contours along with velocity quiver.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## BAD coding practice to avoid\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. No Comments or Documentation:\n",
    "Nothing is explained, making the code very difficult to follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "- No description of input variables and their units\n",
    "- Hard for readers to understand the meaning of the variables, functions, complex equations etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. No Descriptive Variable Names:\n",
    "- Poor Variable Naming: variables like t, v, and v_th are meaningless.\n",
    "- Inconsistency in naming variables\n",
    "- Similar symbols for different types of variables\n",
    "- Abbreviated and unclear names make it hard to understand the logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Hardcoded Values:\n",
    "- Parameters like grid size, viscosity, time, and colormap levels are hardcoded in multiple places.\n",
    "- Constants like pi and e being hard coding\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Poor Formatting:\n",
    "- Code is not indented or aligned properly.\n",
    "- Mixed case in print statements and lack of spacing for readability\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Unformatted Plots:\n",
    "- No axis labels, descriptive title, or consistent scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. No Functions:\n",
    "- The code has no modularization, and repetitive logic is written out manually.\n",
    "- No parameter validation: No validation for physical constraints (e.g., viscosity must be positive)\n",
    "- Function is not generalized or validated for incorrect inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Poor Flexibility and Scalability:\n",
    "- Any change (e.g., resolution) requires editing multiple parts of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Inefficient and Error-Prone:\n",
    "- Explicit loops are computationally expensive for large grids.\n",
    "- Code is harder to debug and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. Repetition:\n",
    "- Plotting blocks are repeated for every field.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. No Error Handling:\n",
    "- The code assumes everything will work without exceptions.\n"
